### Atarashi: Generating OSS License dataset

**Goal:** To create/generate OSS License dataset for [Atarashi](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi)

To implement any Machine learning/Deep learning algorithm we need a better and bigger dataset of [SPDX Licences](https://spdx.org/licenses/). But unfortunately, there exists no such dataset for open source licenses on the web.

There is a loose implementation of n-gramming different permutations and combinations of license text paragraphs. Ref: [SPDX-OSS Dataset](https://github.com/hastagAB/SPDX-OSS-Dataset). This method needs further improvement to make the dataset more accurate and realistic. 

Few suggested improvements: 
- Shifting from txt files to SPDX JSON endpoint
- Differentiating License Header from Full Text
- Adding FOSSology Nomos agent [STRINGS.in](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/blob/master/src/nomos/agent/STRINGS.in) regex in dataset creation
- Apart from these we strongly encourage students to pitch in some new ideas/methods/algorithms to achieve more accurate results.

### Migrating more pages to new UI

FOSSology already have template based UI with the help of Symfony-Twig. In addition, FOSSology is using jQuery-UI, datatable, etc. to generate the pages. These are running for long and FOSSology needs a fresh view. Idea is to rewrite the UI using new technologies like Angular, Bootstrap, Vue.js or ReactJS. The twig-based templating could be considered for reuse.

The FOSSology UI initiated very HTML-90s style which works but does not look good today. A simple HTML has also the advantage that it runs from a variety of machines and different platform. Moreover, some of the PHP scripts even do not return HTML but just character streams. Today, the user base of FOSSology has grown and many persons use the Web UI. **The goal of this project** is to consistently provide a new UI technology to FOSSology which help to build more modern pages.

We have already worked on few pages of UI using bootstrap, Look at [PR - 1774](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/1774). This can be referred as well with Angular Or ReactJS.

And last year, Sahil [proposed a design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/5a36e175-6496-48d7-4b9b-3221c85df525-2c07/) which can be referred for a fresh look. Also, Vivek has created a [proposal wiki](https://github.com/viv9k/fossology/wiki/Rewrite-fossology-UI-into-angular---proposal) which can give a good start into new approach.

### Copyright False Positive Recognition with ML

Fossology has copyright scanner to scan for the new copyrights from a file/packages. The current scanner findings are based on RegExp and has few false-positive findings as well.

The goal of this project is to find a machine learning technique/s that shall improve the copyright finding by detecting the false-positives.

### Migrate from Travis to Github Actions

The FOSSology project needs a continuous integration system to automate builds and tests. Since the beginning on the github, FOSSology has used only the free travis service for OSS projects. 

Now, it seems that using the Github Actions as general workflow automation will provide more versatile ways for implementing concrete continuous build and test services. As such, the current contious integration builds implemented with travis would be required to be migrated to Github Actions. In addition, it would be desirable to update the continuous build targets and used platforms to most recent versions.

### Integrating Open Source Review Toolkit

Build systems fetch the required dependencies (library/artifact) for a project while building the project. Its important to get an insight of these dependencies for license compliance check.

The [OSS Review Toolkit](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort) is an open source project helps to find dependencies in a project.
 
the goal of this project is to render the project dependencies created by ort and display those in the fossology-UI. Dependencies can be scheduled directly from the UI and scan with fossology.

### Integrating Scancode Toolkit

The scancode toolkit is a very established license scanner similar to nomos or monk. It implements a number of different approaches and integrates these into one application for identify and classifying license relevant content in packages.

The basic idea is to use the command line interface from the scancode package in order to be called right from the fossology application. Fossology will pass a single file and takes the result from the scanscode command line call.

Major work will be required to adapt the existing integration of atrashi, in order reuse the efforts for a same integration with the scancode.

### Integration of Reuse Project

Integrating [REUSE](https://reuse.software/) with fossology

Copyright and licensing is difficult, especially when reusing software from different projects that are released under various different licenses. REUSE make it easier for you to declare the licenses under which your works are released, but they also make it easier for a computer to understand how your project is licensed.
This specification defines a standardized method for declaring copyright and licensing for software projects.
REUSE also helps in creating a bill of materials with just one simple command. 

**The goal of this project**
* check license and copyrights for each files of package.
* List of files without licensing information, can to notified to the user of that package.

- https://reuse.software/spec/
- https://git.fsfe.org/reuse/tool

Existing issues:
- _Integrate REUSE standard_: #1592
- _Support the `SPDX-FileCopyrightText` keyword explicitly in the copyright agent_ #1513 
- _Detect 'foobar.license' files, as part of RESUE.Software standard_ #1833

### Making FOSSology architecture more microservice friendly

FOSSology is designed in modular fashion but it certainly does not follow micro-service architecture. For example, if there is a change in monk's logic, the whole source code has to be built again and installed. Whereas in micro-service architecture, only monk needs to be built and installed/deployed.

**Existing behavior:** In the current state, FOSSology is capable enough to run in a cluster mode. It can connect to other nodes in a cluster over SSH and execute agents. But it is not very flexible and has following drawbacks:

- When adding or removing a node, scheduler needs to be restarted.
- Every node needs to have same set of agents.
  + For example, you can not have one machine running only monk and one running only copyright.
- Because of the current version check mechanism on scheduler, for a single change, the whole code base needs to be redeployed to get new version string.
- The current architecture requires `fo-postinstall` to run on every new deployment to ensure correct DB schema and migrations.
  + Even though it is not a big push back, but it causes problems for some implementations. See [#1841](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/issues/1841), [#1818](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/issues/1818) and [#1809](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/issues/1809).

**Goal:** When the FOSSology follows more microservice friendly architecture, it can be deployed on Kubernetes and be able to scale-out or scale-in based on demand.
