The definition of done helps to set a common understanding for solving a ticket.

### Definition of done policy

* Review points should involve one person from another angle (not just the person you were sitting together with anyways)
* Limit items in review to 5, try to coordinate 
 # Using Github assignments to issues or pull requests
 # then the mailing list
* Open review items requires mailing list

### Definition of done items

* File headers in file OK
 * GPLv2 License (see code style)
 * Or, if the file is too small, configuration file: license note (see code style)
 * Copyright and Author

* Avoid (seriously) compiler warnings
 * Fast forward merge to master
 * That means that merge to master is prepared

* No breaking test
 * Unit, php and c
 * You have more - use them!

* New test

* Documentation
 * in the Githuib Wiki-Section if you have done something new

* **Review**
 * Code style
