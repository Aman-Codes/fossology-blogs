## The ECC Agent

The ECC agent should scan for relevant phrases w.r.t. to export control and customs issues based on regular expressions. There could be separate agents that allow for finding results w.r.t. specific topic, if required.

#### GUI Spec

There was a GUI spec for this at the early development, when it came to design an efficient clearing user interface.

At further evolution of the agent, it turned out that some general interface for copyrights and ECC statements (and maybe another agent) is beneficial, which was implemented as such.

#### Clearing Result:

There should be clearing "titles" for the clearing result.

For ECC, this would be called "Identified export restriction‚Äù. However, which are these? - Input is appreciated here.

For example: The clearing experts identifies a statement being a TSU statement or reference. Then, the result could be labelled TSU reference. In "the not shown GUI Mockup", we can see already some proposals for ECC clearing results. What would be other clearing results for the report? The list requires completion.
