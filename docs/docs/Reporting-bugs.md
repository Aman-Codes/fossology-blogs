FOSSology uses GitHub's issue tracker. All bugs and enhancements should be entered so that we don't lose track of them, can prioritize, assign, and so code fixes can refer to the bug number in its check-in comments.

The issue usually contains much more detail (including test cases) than can be reasonably put in check-in comments, so being able to correlate the two is important.

Consider the usual best practice for writing issues, among them:

* More verbosity rather than one liners can be helpful.
* Screenshots are a great help.
* Providing example files (in case for example scanning crashes) is also useful.
* Please determine the version, better the commit id.
