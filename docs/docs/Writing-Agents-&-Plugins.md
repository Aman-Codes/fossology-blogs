A module is some functionality that is added to FOSSology. Adding a module to fossology can be done with either a plugin or an agent. To get started extending FOSSology, let's go through a series of working examples:

1. A demo module was written for 2.4.0. Look in the source tarball at fossology/src/demomod. This is a simple module that demonstrates how to write for the UI and background agent. It can be used as a template for any new agents.

2. [A simple example: Hello World UI plugin](http://www.fossology.org/projects/fossology/wiki/Hello_world)

3. [The basic UI plugin template: FO-plugin](http://www.fossology.org/projects/fossology/wiki/FO_Plugin)

4. [A progressive agent tutorial](http://www.fossology.org/projects/fossology/wiki/Regexscan) - Based upon 2.2.0 release.
